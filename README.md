Project members: Juho Matilainen,

Project leader: Juho Matilainen

Goal: Make e-puck robot able to solve different kind of mazes

Time reserved: 50h per member

Project supervisors: Dr. Ilkka Jormanainen, Dr. Samuel Tewelde Yigzaw

TODO: 

  1) Make e-puck controller that can traverse a maze and not get stuck.
  2) Make e-puck controler able to create a graph of the maza that it traverses
  3) Add more worlds/mazes for the robot to solve

  This is projectwork for Robotics course. Goal of this project is to make e-puck robot able to solve mazes.
  We will discuss with project members how we will implement the function to solve mazes.
  Initial plan was to make the robot use Breadth-first search(bfs) and map the maze junctions as vertexes and make edges between vertexes that are connected in the maze.
  Also added base files for webot program. There is 1 world with easy maze and unedited e-puck controller.
