This is projectwork for Robotics course. Goal of this project is to make e-puck robot able to solve mazes.
We will discuss with project members how we will implement the function to solve mazes.
Initial plan was to make the robot use Breadth-first search(bfs) and map the maze junctions as vertexes and make edges between vertexes that are connected in the maze.
